# Project Objective: Jio/Hotstar OTT Analytics Dashboard (Power BI)

The objective of this project is to design and develop an interactive Power BI dashboard to analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) and user behavior metrics for an OTT (Over-the-Top) streaming platform such as Jio or Hotstar. The dashboard aims to provide insights into:

-Subscriber growth trends, including daily, weekly, and monthly active users

-Content performance analysis, such as most-watched shows or movies and genre popularity

-Revenue analytics, including subscription models, advertising revenue, and average revenue per user (ARPU)

-User demographics, including age groups and location-based usage patterns

-Watch time and engagement metrics, such as average session duration and peak viewing hours

-Churn and retention rates to measure customer loyalty

-Strategic decision support for marketing, content acquisition, and overall business strategy

# Questions (KPIs)

-How are content ratings distributed across different shows and how have they changed over time?

-How do viewership trends differ between movies and series across different time periods?

-What are the most popular genres in each country and what languages are most commonly used?

-Which genres, directors, and actors are the most watched or highly rated?

-How has the volume and type of content released changed over the years?

# Process

-Clean and Transform Data: Prepare the raw IMDb-style dataset by parsing genres, release dates, and runtime; standardizing countries, and splitting multi-valued fields (e.g., genres, languages).

-Analyze Content Performance: Calculate the number of shows, movies, and series per year, and track IMDb ratings, votes, and runtime patterns across the platform.

-Identify Trends: Observe trends over time such as changes in content types (Movies vs Series), increase in highly-rated content, and evolution of genres.

-Segment and Compare Data: Break down content performance by country, language, rating, and genre, and compare viewer preferences across regions.

-Provide Granular Insights: Visualize daily/annual release trends, top-performing genres by country, content type distribution, and patterns in ratings and votes.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT – Jio Hotstar Content Insights

-Streaming platforms like Disney+ Hotstar offer thousands of shows and movies, but:

-The content catalog is massive and fragmented — it’s difficult to track what type of content dominates the platform.

-Understanding audience preferences across countries and languages is a challenge.

-Identifying top-rated or most engaging genres and release trends requires deep visual analysis.

-Content planners struggle to spot genre saturation, rating trends, or runtime patterns without an interactive dashboard.
